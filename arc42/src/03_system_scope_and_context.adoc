We assume that potential customers already have some sort of Content-Management-System in place we need to integrate with. So we must be able to provide content (e.g. documentation) in a format that's easy to work with (e.g. favor plain text over PDF). The CMS could be an API management solution as well, depending on the customers infrastructure.

NOTE: if there is no CMS in place we provide the proper UI
