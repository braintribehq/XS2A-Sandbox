For all the tests in Redirect and Embedded approaches it is required to use PIN for logging into the account and TAN number for SCA. Please, use available email addresses that you can access for your users, because generated TAN number will be sent to email of chosen user.

Test value for PIN for all automatically generated users: 12345.

Test value for TAN (valid only if you run Sandbox locally with 'dev' profile): 123456.
