## Introduction

The [Payment Service Directive 2 (PSD2)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32015L2366&from=EN)
instructs banks (Account Servicing Payment Service Providers or ASPSPs) to provide a fully productive Access-to-Account (XS2A)
interface to Third Party Providers (TPPs) until September 2019. XS2A
itself consists of banking services to initiate payments (PIS), request
account data (AIS) and get the confirmation of the availability of funds
(PIIS). In order to guarantee the compliance of this deadline due to
adaptions and bugs, PSD2 claims the banks to provide a functional dynamic
sandbox offering the XS2A services in a non-productive environment until
June 2019.

The **XS2ABank** is a dynamic sandbox environment that fully meets the PSD2 requirements for providing APIs for Third-Party Providers (TPP). Based on the Berlin Groupâ€™s NextGen PSD2 specification for access to accounts (XS2A), **XS2ABank** meets all the regulatory requirements and is NISP compliant.

This developer portal is created to help TPP developers start working with XS2ABank.

## XS2ABank architecture and modules

_Figure 1.1: Components of the XS2ABank_

### XS2A Interface

Central component of the **XS2ABank** is the **XS2A interface** which
meets the requirements of the [Berlin Group](https://www.berlin-group.org/)
(Version 1.3) and is based on test data. You can
visit our documentation here [XS2A Swagger UI](/swagger-ui.html) or find full [OpenSource XS2A Interface on Github](https://github.com/adorsys/xs2a).

### ASPSP-Profile

Besides the actual interface, PSD2 instructs ASPSPs to offer a technical documentation free of charge containing
amongst others, information about supported payment products and payment
services. This information is stored in **ASPSP-profile** (bank profile), a service based on yaml file where a bank can provide available payment products, payment services, supported SCA approaches and other bank-specific settings.

#### Active XS2A Configuration (Bank Profile) (EDIT ALL AFTER ENV CREATION)

- Supported SCA-Approach: Redirect
- Available payment types and payment products for each type:
  - Single (sepa-credit-transfers)
  - Future-Dated (sepa-credit-transfers)
  - Periodic (sepa-credit-transfers)
- Confirmation of Funds: supported
- Redirect URLs to Online Banking:
  - Redirect URL for Payment confirmation: ** url **
  - Redirect URL for Payment cancellation: ** url **
  - Redirect URL for Account Consent confirmation: ** url **
- Supported types of Consents:
  - Dedicated: Yes
  - Bank-Offered: Yes
  - Global: No
  - Available Accounts: No

Disabled features:

- Signing Basket
- Bulk Payments
- Delta-Reports
- Multi-Level SCA

```

### TPP Certificate Service

Usually, before accessing the XS2A services a TPP would need to register
at its National Competent Authority (NCA) and request an
[eIDAS](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910&from=EN)
certificate at an appropriate Trust Service Provider (TSP). Issuing a
real certificate just for testing purposes would be too much effort,
which is why the **XS2ABank** is additionally simulating a fictional
TSP issuing Qualified Website Authentication Certificates (QWAC). A QWAC
is part of eIDAS and might be better known as [X.509](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3739.txt)
certificate. For PSD2-purposes the certificate gets extended by the QcStatement
containing appropriate values such as the role(s) of the PSP (see
[ETSI](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/119400_119499/119495/01.01.02_60/ts_119495v010102p.pdf)).

After embedding the QWAC in the actual XS2A request, the role and the
signature get validated at a central reverse proxy before it gets
finally passed to the interface where the banking logic happens.

### TPP User Interface

A TPP developers can download test data for their TPP application using generated certificate and [prepared data](link to data!).

### Online banking

In case of REDIRECT SCA approach a user wants to provide consent for using their account information or for payment confirmation/cancellation. Online banking is a user interface to provide consent to a bank. Links for a consent confirmation and payment confirmation or cancellation are provided in the response of the corresponding endpoints.
